The Java memory model used internally in the JVM divides memory between thread stacks and the heap.
Each thread running in the JVM has its own thread stack.
The thread stack contains information about what methods the thread has called to reach the current point of execution.
 As the thread executes its code, the call stack changes.
  contains all local variables for each method being executed (all methods on the call stack).
 A thread can only access it's own thread stack.
 Local variables created by a thread are invisible to all other threads than the thread who created it.


The heap contains all objects created in your Java application, regardless of what thread created the object
